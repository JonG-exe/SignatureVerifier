Instructions for running "Preprocessing - Augmentation.ipynb"

- "Preprocessing - Augmentation.ipynb" should be ran before "Signature_Verifier.ipynb" in the event that the images
to be used require augmentation such as grayscaling and rotation.

	- In cell (2) add the path for your dataset containing genuine/real signatures.
	- Do the same for cell (3) forg_folder_dir, but in the case, you're providing it the path to forged/faked 	
		signatures.
